# pluginnode-docker

### by nmzn // twitter: @itsnmzn 2022 ###

Please take note that this is an automated Script for the installation and setup process for a Plugin Oracle node.
I have not made any modifications to the docker containers included.

### Please also be aware that setting up a node brings some maintenance responsibilities with it.
### Setting up a node is not for beginners.
### If youre a beginner, please also see https://docs.goplugin.co for further info on how this stuff works.

# Remix and Deployment Part still needs to be done manually!
